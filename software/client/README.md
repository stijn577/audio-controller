# audio-controller-client

This code is the code that runs on the external hardware. It's the code for the controller that sends data to the OS. The code is found in src. The pinout can be found in the ioc, I use this to easily generate the clock configs and pinouts during the project, the final design is then used to design the circuit for the pcb.
